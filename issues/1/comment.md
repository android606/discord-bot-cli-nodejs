The migration of the Node.js Discord bot files from the android606/dita-ot repository to this repository encountered an issue when attempting to automate the process. The task involves extracting relevant files introduced or modified in PR #5 of the dita-ot repository, ensuring the project structure remains consistent, and updating configurations for the new context. This needs to be addressed manually or with further investigation into the automation failure.
